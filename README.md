# Final Project (MSc Data Science) - City, University of London.

The project is based on AI memory abstraction using deep reinforcement learning.

----

### Goal:

The main goal is to teach an agent to play an Atari game, and then, use this information to play a different game, instead of learning the new game from scratch.

### How it works:

The underneath logic is based on Q-Learning algorithm, then a deep neural network was applied to get knowledge of the environment in form of pixels. Once this model is set, all the information is stored as a memory.

Finally, the agent play a different game, using the previous game experiences stored in memory as initialization.
